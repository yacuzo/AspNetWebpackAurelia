# ASP.NET Core with webpack and aurelia 

This is stiched together based on [ASP.NET JavasriptServices](https://github.com/aspnet/JavaScriptServices) (through yeoman aspnetcore-spa) and [aurelia's skeleton-typescript-webpack](https://github.com/aurelia/skeleton-navigation/tree/master/skeleton-typescript-webpack)

This is far from complete


## Why not webpack 2 / typescript 2
It is actually AspNet.JavascriptServices which runs webpack during development, and they have their own webpack/typescript version.

## Why not @easy-webkit/config-sass
It didnt play well with webpack 1.
